            <h1>What is BrainOBrain?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>BrainOBrain is an extra-curricular activity. I teach mathematics and it's effective tricks on an abacus.
                An
                abacus is a Chinese instrument used for calculating. Using it and regular practice makes it
                faster than a calculator!!!. So, we teach them tricks that make them faster than a calculator. By
                the way, it is an indian company started in <b>Chennai</b>.</p>
            <br>
            <p> We not only teach mathematics , but we also organise an interschool commpetion for all children. In this
                competion, children have to do mental maths, logical abilty, General Knowledge and Speed handwriting in
                only 40mins!. We also organise other competions on different levels like-State levle, National level,
                International level.</p>
            <br>
            <hr color="white">
            <h1>How and why it was started ?</h1>
            <p>BrainoBrain was establishd in 2003 in Chennai. It was made and established beacuse of shaping of the new
                world. By teaching them mathematics.</p>
            <br>
            <video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
            <br>
            <p>By the example of this video ,all the brainobrain students can do fast calculations. We don't only teach
                them but, we also take their examinations in each level to check that each and every student is doing
                good or not.</p>

                    <p>I am Gorav Pandey of class 5 studying at Guru Kripa Divine Grace Public School Bahraich recently
                        completed Level 10 of BrainOBrain Course,embarking on the BrainOBrain Course with the guidance
                        of the incredible Reena Ma'am has
                        been a truly enlightening experience. As I recently completed this transformative course, I am
                        eager to share the remarkable journey it has taken me on.

                        The Beginning of My BrainOBrain Adventure:
                        From the very first day, I sensed that BrainOBrain was unlike any other educational program I
                        had encountered before. It was not just about numbers and calculations; it was about unlocking
                        the full potential of the human mind.

                        Unlocking Mental Arithmetic Mastery:
                        Under the patient and skillful guidance of Reena Ma'am, I delved into the world of mental
                        arithmetic.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <p>I am Madhav Argrwal of class 5 studying in Guru Kripa Divine Grace Public School. I joined
                        BrainOBrain in class 1. I was too bad at math at that time, but after joining BrainOBrain I am
                        very fast in doing calculations. When joining in class 1, I only
                        completed this course till level 4 then Covid came. After that when I gone BrainOBrain
                        again I found my classmate Gorav Pandey there in my level. We both were best at math in our
                        class. Before teacher solves the question we knew the answer it correctly. Now, I am in class 5
                        and I feel very proud and my mathematics is also improved lot.</p>
                    <p>BrainOBrain is a skill based program that teaches us math tricks, improve General
                        knowledge, improve vocabulary and also improves conversation in English.</p>

                    <p>I am mother of Gorav Pandey. BrainOBrain is a fantastic course, it enhances concentration power,
                        memory and
                        multitasking skill of a child.</p>
                    <p>I suggest it for every child as it boosts up a childâ€™s capability in academics</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <p> When we enrolled our child in Brainobrain, we were intrigued by the promises of cognitive
                        development and academic improvement. Little did we know just how profoundly this course would
                        impact our child's life.

                        Reena Ma'am: A Guiding Light:
                        From the very first interaction with Reena Ma'am, we knew that our child was in capable hands.
